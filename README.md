## How to work on this project?

The repository and the entire solution module is divided by Git tags. Start from the git tag corresponding to the module you are interested in:

1. Clone the repository, if you haven't already:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:freddydc/rustlings-exercises.git
```

2. Update tag information:

```bash
git fetch --tags
```

3. List the available tags:

```bash
git tag
```

You should see something like:

```bash
1.0.0
```

4. Start a new branch from the point you want:

```bash
git checkout -b name-of-my-branch chosen-label
# For example, to create a branch named 'dev' from '1.0.0' tag
git checkout -b dev 1.0.0
```

๐ฅ That's all, you can start with all the changes included up to that module.

> ๐ก In the [Releases](https://github.com/freddydc/rustlings-exercises/releases) section you can find the entire list of tags.
